Blitzen Engine 0 x edition is similar to the alpha edition but compiles into an executable and uses draw indirect.

Like the Alpha edition, it can load gltf scenes and draw them but without any PBR effects or anything like that.

It recently went through a refactor based on the work I am doing on the 0.C edition. As a result, I have neglected reimplementing some features, like camera rotation.

I will probably not be updating this project any longer as I have changed my style while writing the 0.C edition.
